            <b>Hi I'm Luke!</b>
              <p>I'm a 4th year Automation Engineering student at McMaster University. I'm a hard-working student with an interest in mechanical design. After completing my undergrad, I hope to go on to pursue an accelerated MBA and an MEng from McMaster.</p>
              <p>I excel in any situation I'm put in, both for independent and group situations.</p>
              <p>I hope to work as a fire system designer or have a job in defense after I finish all my schooling.</p>
